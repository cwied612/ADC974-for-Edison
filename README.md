# ADC974-for-Edison

This repository will contain the code used to connect the AD974 and the LSM303 to the Intel Edison

The different codes will be used in conjunction to achieve a device that takes data from 4 hydrophones
and records it.  It will will also record the direction and movement of the acoustic monitoring device.
